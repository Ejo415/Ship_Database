Welcome to Starfleets new Ship Database!

Before use registration is required with an Unique username. From there you will start with zero ships in your fleet, so create ships with a Name, a Class, a Registry Number, and its Affiliation. The editing of ship details is only possible by the user who created it.

To add crew to its roster please go to the Crew Roster page to add a Crew Member to the Database and assign them a ship. Please note than all crew are shared and to make sure that they do not already have an assignment before assigning them to your ship. Crew transfers require written authorization.
